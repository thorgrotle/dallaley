Ubuntu 18.04

Download the ubuntu server alternative iso
Write that to USB key (Using: Etcher.io, Startup Disk Make, dd)
Connect Console cable and listen at speed 115200n8 (putty)
Press F10 and boot from USB
Boot error will occur, enter the following to boot with serial enabled:
install vga=off console=ttyS0,115200n8

Or for rescue:
rescue vga=off console=ttyS0,115200n8

Install with LVM2 - make sure there is space for snapshot, that will make it easyer to run a reset.

After install, run ip addr to see interfaces like NIC and wlan + MAC adresses
